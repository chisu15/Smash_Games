I started making mobile games in my dorm room, but it wasn’t until I made my first PC game, Magicite, that I realized that being a game developer could be my lifelong career. Once Magicite’s Kickstarter was a success, I dropped out of college to fully commit myself to making games. I haven’t looked back since! My favorite game is Monster Hunter World. My friends and I would set up 4 TV’s and PS4s in my living room and we would just have a blast hunting monsters.”

                                “Interacting with the Townsfolk, for sure! Fulfilling their requests, discovering their personalities, and even doing some romance makes me feel like the world of Solemn is a real place. I look forward to seeing the players’ reaction to the Townsfolk, and which ones they find to be their favorites!”

                                “There currently is no plan for multiplayer in Littlewood. If the game generates enough interest and there is a demand for something like that, then I will definitely consider adding it to this game or maybe even making a sequel. My primary goal with Littlewood is to deliver a solid single player experience in which the player can escape to their own little world.”

                                The background story so far for Littlewood is about a hero who has finished their journey and is now rebuilding the town. Is there more story about our adventurer? Or the town?

I hope players will find this method of storytelling to be as exciting and interesting as I do! There’s something charming about being dropped into a world where everyone already loves you.”

                                “It’s so hard to pick a favorite out of the current cast of Townsfolk. But if I had to go with one, I would pick Dalton. His high energy, silly jokes, and innocent stupidity has been so fun to write for. He is a primary way for the player to relive their past adventures because he was one of the Townsfolk who knew you best when you were on your journey to defeat the Dark Wizard.”

I appreciate the interest and the growing community so much, and launch day will come soon enough!”
                                “Thanks for your interest in my game and I hope that you will enjoy escaping to the world of Littlewood when it launches on both Steam and Nintendo Switch. Cheers!”

                                It was great to get some exclusive information regarding Littlewood and get to know the developer, Sean Young a little better. Littlewood will be out in early access on steam NEXT MONTH so there’s not much more of a wait! You can add it to your wishlist HERE and be ready for when it launches next month. Happy Gaming!
