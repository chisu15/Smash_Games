I started making mobile games in my dorm room, but it wasn’t until I made my first PC game, Magicite, that I realized that being a game developer could be my lifelong career. Once Magicite’s Kickstarter was a success, I dropped out of college to fully commit myself to making games. I haven’t looked back since! My favorite game is Monster Hunter World. My friends and I would set up 4 TV’s and PS4s in my living room and we would just have a blast hunting monsters.”</textarea>

I was having a blast hanging out with my animal friends and… Doing odd chores around town. This really perplexed me, because how could players have fun picking weeds and doing things that we might find boring in real life? This had such a profound effect on my views of game design, that I had to try to make a game that could capture such a charming and relaxing world. That’s when Littlewood was born!”</textarea>

Littlewood will be out in early access on steam NEXT MONTH so there’s not much more of a wait! You can add it to your wishlist HERE and be ready for when it launches next month.
