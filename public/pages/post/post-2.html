                                Littlewood is a peaceful RPG that takes place after you’ve already saved the world. You get to relax, master new hobbies, make new friends, get married, and customize your town! It takes great inspiration from Animal Crossing, Runescape, and Dark Cloud.

                                I created SmashGames in 2014 and it is just me. For Kindergarten 1 & 2 I collaborated with another developer at Con Man Games, and I was just the artist for those projects. Otherwise, all other SmashGames titles have been just me.

                                If you are a game developer just starting out, please don’t wait! Start making games right NOW! I went to college for Computer Science for 2 years before dropping out, and learning everything that I needed to know with Youtube tutorials. Anyone can make a game, it just requires hard work and diligence. It is better to start a project and complete it than to start 100 projects and finish none of them.
